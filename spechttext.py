# speechrecognition (Simple & Quick)
# Uses various backends like Google Web Speech API, Sphinx, and Wit.ai.
# Works well for simple real-time applications but requires an internet connection for high accuracy (Google API).
# Best for: Quick prototypes, online speech-to-text, lightweight projects.
